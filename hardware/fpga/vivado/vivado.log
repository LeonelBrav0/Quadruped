Changes in your design (including the PCW configuration settings) are not automatically exported from Vivado to Xilinx's SDK, Petalinux or Yocto.
This is by design to avoid disrupting existing embedded development efforts. To have any changes of your design taking effect in the embedded software flow please export your
design by going through Vivado's main menu, click on File, then Export finally select Export Hardware, please ensure you click on the Include BitStream option.
The auto-generated HDF file is all you need to import in Xilinx's SDK, Petalinux or Yocto for your changes to be reflected in the Embedded Software Flow.

WARNING: [Project 1-498] One or more constraints failed evaluation while reading constraint file [/home/use/Projects/quadruped/hardware/fpga/vivado/project/Project_Q.srcs/constrs_1/imports/constraints/project_Q.xdc] and the design contains unresolved black boxes. These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/Project_Q_wrapper_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/use/Projects/quadruped/hardware/fpga/vivado/project/Project_Q.srcs/constrs_1/imports/constraints/project_Q.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/Project_Q_wrapper_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/Project_Q_wrapper_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.
