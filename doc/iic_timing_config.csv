"TSUSTA",143,"Setup time for a repeated START condition. Calculation: (5.7 µs / 40 ns) = 142.5 rounded to 143"
"TSUSTO",125,"Setup time for a repeated STOP condition. Calculation: (5 µs / 40 ns) = 125"
"THDSTA",100,"Hold time for a repeated START condition. Calculation: (4 µs / 40 ns) = 100"
"TSUDAT",6,"Data setup time. Calculation: (250 ns / 40 ns) = 6.25 rounded to 6"
"TBUF",118,"Bus free time between a STOP and START condition. Calculation: (4.7 µs / 40 ns) = 117.5 rounded to 118"
"THIGH",118,"High period of the SCL clock. Calculation: (25 MHz / (2 x 100 kHz)) - 7 = 125 - 7 = 118"
